We looked to other map projects such as Photogrammar and al Turraya to learn what features were possible in Leaflet (our mapping tool), and which ones we wanted to add to our own map.</p>\n<p>As we gained new insights, we wrote them down into a PowerPoint and document. We presented what knowledge we gained to our peers. With their help, we created a document with feedback and ways for us to improve and clarify our project.</p>\n<p>The map came next, with us adding datapoints to create a basic map in leaflet.</p>\n<p>Finally, we compiled our information online. </p>\n<p>These tools were chosen to help us create our project in an efficient and accurate way. Microsoft Word and Google Docs were used to write, with Word being superior offline and Docs being superior for collaboration. Google Sheets allowed each of us to add datapoints gathered to a common place. These datapoints allowed us to build the map in Leaflet, which we chose for its features (gathered in other DH projects) and compatibility. Github and Publii were chosen to build and host the website. A peer recommended these programs to us, and we enjoyed using them.</p>",
